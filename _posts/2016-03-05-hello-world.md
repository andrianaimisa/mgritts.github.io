I've been looking for a way to contribute to the R community and a Jekyll blog seems like a good way to accomplish this goal.

Introductions...

My name is Mitchell Gritts. I work for the Nevada Department of Wildlife. My current role is a bit of a combination of data manager, analyst and developer. I suppose this is a role that many technologically competent wildlife biologists fill.

I graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno with a degree in wildlife ecology and conservation. My undergraduate research focused on molecular evolution and ecology. That was in 2011. Since then I've worked for Washington Conservation Corps, then NDOW.

I'm currently developing data pipelines for my fellow wildlife biologists at NDOW, and am considering heading back to school for a Masters degree.

But really, I'm testing out Jekyll!
