This week I worked on more RESTful best practices, and again using the online course I've been following. This is one of the example projects. I've been working on it for a couple of weeks now, and it isn't finished, but I'm on a short vacation and have worked on it a little bit and need a project.<!--more-->

This project is uses mongo as the database, node on the backend and express as the framework. I'm still keeping it simple by not using a frontend framework yet. The poject uses passportjs for user authentication.

The code is on GitHub.
