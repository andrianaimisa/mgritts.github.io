[Yesterday I posted][2] about setting up Express to run with Sequelize.js with the basic restful routes. I used Postman to interact with the database. There weren't any webpages, etc. Today I decided to go all out and set up all the RESTful routes and database interactions. The [repo is here][1] and is very simple. I didn't use any CSS to make the pages pretty. All I wanted was the basic functionality of a website with RESTful routing and Sequilize. Nearly everything worked the first time around, that was really exciting. There isn't much else to say. My next post will be a little more detailed about how to set everything up. I'll be including user authentication and associations (hopefully I figure them out). I'm starting that right now! *end*
