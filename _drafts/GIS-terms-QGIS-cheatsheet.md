QGIS is an open source geographic information system similar to ESRI products. I try to do all of my GIS work in R, but every once in a while I need a GUI. For instance, QA/QCing geographic point data with several polygon layers. Sometimes I need it for interactively exploring shapefiles and associated attributes without writing my own leaflet function. Regardless, it is a good tool for the toolbox and much better than ESRI products.
