title: Reno R Users

## Reno R User Group

R is an open source programming language for statistical computing, data analysis, and visualization. R has a growing user base and an active development community. R is used in academia, computational biology, applied statistics, and data science. It is even gaining ground in the quantitative finance and business intelligence. All of these communities have contributed to R by developing packages, creating tutorials, and other R user groups. As great as the community is, R does have a steep learning curve and has some interesting quirks.

The Reno R Users Group is dedicated to bringing together users to exchange knowledge, inspire new users, and spur the adoption of R for innovative research and commercial applications.

## Meetings

The first meeting will be April 7, 2016 from 6pm - 8pm. During the first meeting we will schedule the next couple of meetings. Generally meetings will consist of one or two talks about applications of R, tutorials, and troubleshooting R code.
