## Reno R User Group

R is an open source programming language for statistical computing, data analysis, and visualization. R has a growing user base and an active development community. R is used in academia, computational biology, applied statistics, and data science. It is even gaining ground in the quantitative finance and business intelligence. All of these communities have contributed to R by developing packages. As great as the community is, R does have a steep learning curve.

The Reno R Users Group is dedicated to bringing together users to exchange knowledge, inspire new users, and spur the adoption of R for innovative research and commercial applications.

## Meetings

Meetings are currently scheduled for the first Thursday of every month. The first meeting will be April 7, 2016 from 6pm - 8pm (tentatively). The venue is TBD. If we can generate enough interest in the group I would like to have a series of "lightning talks" to introduce new or beginning users to the applications of R

## Agenda

The first meeting will consist of introductions, an introduction to R, general business, and planning future meetings.

Generally meetings will consist of one or two talks about applications of R, tutorials, and troubleshooting R.

## Interested

Email mitchellgritts@gmail.com to get on an email list for updates or if you are interested in presenting a lightning talk for the first meeting.
