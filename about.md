I'm a wildlife ecologist and a bit of an R nerd. This site is a bit of an outlet for that! I work as a data manager for the Nevada Department of Wildlife. Lately I've been working on designing Shiny applications to make data pipelines for wildlife biologists. As I learn, or struggle, with R I'll post info here. I figure I'm not the only wildlife biologist struggling with this stuff!

I've been reading [Carl Boettiger's](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html) lab notebooks and OpenWetWare. I'm a huge fan of Open Source. In an effort to contribute to the Open Source community by sharing my work as best I can on this site. The site will also serve as a permanent brain dump for procedures and methods as I learn them. A good example, I deployed a Shiny application on AWS and several weeks later I had to deploy another on my employers AWS server. For a some terrible reason I didn't document how I did any of it. Hence the post on deploying a Shiny Server.
