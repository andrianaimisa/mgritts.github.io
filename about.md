I'm a wildlife ecologist and a bit of an R nerd. This site is a bit of an outlet for that! I work as a data manager for the Nevada Department of Wildlife. Lately I've been working on designing Shiny applications to make data pipelines for wildlife biologists.

As I learn, or struggle, with R I'll post info here. I figure I'm not the only wildlife biologist struggling with this stuff!
