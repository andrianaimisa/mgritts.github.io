I'm a wildlife ecologist and a bit of an R nerd. This site is a bit of an outlet for that! I work as a data manager for the Nevada Department of Wildlife. Lately I've been working on designing Shiny applications to make data pipelines for wildlife biologists. As I learn, or struggle, with R I'll post info here. I figure I'm not the only wildlife biologist struggling with this stuff!

## Open Lab Notebook

After reading [Carl Boettiger's](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html) lab notebooks and OpenWetWare I decided to use this site as my open lab notebook. I'm a huge fan of Open Source, in an effort to contribute to the Open Source community I will be sharing my work as best I can on this site.

The site will also serve as a permanent brain dump for procedures and methods as I learn them. Posts tagged lab notebook will be more of a brain dump than a tutorial or walk through. A good example, I deployed a Shiny application on AWS and several weeks later I had to deploy another on my employers AWS server. For a some terrible reason I didn't document how I did any of it. Hence the post on deploying a Shiny Server.

## The Site

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/), a blog aware, static website generator. I write posts/pages with a combination of markdown, html, and css in [Atom](https://atom.io/), a text editor by GitHub. I am using the [Poole/Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) with a few customizations (source code on GitHub). The site is hosted on github using GitHub Pages and Amazon Web Services S3. I use [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) to push the site to AWS. (Tutorial to be written soon). My domain name is registered with [hover](https://hover.com/BaFZAVz0), by far one of the easiest (and coolest, they sponsor [Radiotopia](https://www.radiotopia.fm/), my favorite podcast network) DNS providers I've used.

### Feeds

The following links are RSS feeds. The first is for all my posts, the second for R related posts.
